- 👋 Hi, I’m @SilvioMartin42
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to how raw data is transformed so that it can be used for decision making by a machine or a human.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how data engineers, data scientists, machine learning engineers and others work together to create the most value for end users without data literacy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on BI Guidance systems
- 📫 Reach out to me via linkedin
